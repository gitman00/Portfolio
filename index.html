            <p>
                Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes. My name is Manish Ghimire . I was born on Nepal and Currently living in the Butwal City.I am a person who loves to code and learn new things. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen musics.

                <br>
                <br>

                I always wanted to be a great writer and a good programmer.  I am nowhere close those people who benn a great inspiration to me to join IT. I am just someone who does some learning new things, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.

                <br>
                <br> 

                This is a brief introduction of myself. If you are interested in knowing more, read my blogs or take a look at my pictures. Do not expect too much, and keep your sense of humor.
